<h1>Contemporary China No. 3: 清明节 (qīngmíng jié)</h1>
<p class="byline">posted on <span class="date">07 Apr 2012</span> by <span class="author">Alex</span></p>

<aside class="notice">
  <p>Instead of having a Chinese culture <em>class</em>, Alex and Rocky are having adventures in and around Beijing.  "Contemporary China" is a series of blog posts that takes a look at our experiences with Chinese culture.</p>
</aside>



<p>This is Alex here again with a blog post about a recent Chinese holiday that
just took place.  It is one of China&#39;s many ghost holidays the occur throughout
the year and it is very important to many Chinese and their families.  I am
speaking about the holiday known as 清明节 (qīngmíng jié).</p>

<p>清明节, or Tomb Sweeping Festival, is a time for many Chinese to go and visit
the graves of their ancestors and departed  loved ones and honor them by
cleaning their tombstones.  清明节 is also one of the few Chinese festivals that
is based on a solar calendar rather than on the lunar calendar.  The festival
usually starts on April 2, but the actual day to visit graves is usually on
April 5.  That the festival fell on April 4 this year is quite interesting.  In
Chinese, the word for four is 四 (sì).  The word for death is 死 (sǐ).  As the
sounds are very similar, the number four gets a bad wrap and is widely
considered unlucky.  April is the fourth month of the year, so this year, the
holiday that is concerned with the dead happened on 4/4, a day that sounds very
similar to death/death.</p>

<p>Being half-Chinese myself and interested in the Chinese culture, I truly wanted
to fully participate in this holiday.  But since I was stuck in Beijing and
unable to visit my father&#39;s village in 广东 (guǎngdōng) I decided to do the next
best thing and visit the graves that belong to the founders of my Kung Fu school
instead.  Because I felt if could not properly honor family, at least I would
gain merit in honoring teachers.</p>

<p>The two main Kung Fu masters that I would be seeing are 董海川 (Dǒng Hǎichuān)
and 李子鳴 (Lǐ Zǐmíng).  They are two famous and crucial practitioners of the
martial arts I practice known as 八卦掌 (Bāguàzhǎng).  I was surprised to find
that their graves were only 28 minutes from my school to the West and near the
Summer place as well a cemetery known as 万安公墓 (Wàn ān gōngmù).</p>

<p><a href="/static/image/blog/qingmingjie/wanan_entrance.jpg"><img src="/static/image/blog/qingmingjie/wanan_entrance_m.jpg" alt="万安公墓"></a></p>

<p>When I arrived to the entrance of the cemetery, it was bustling with activity;
people were gathering at the entrance to buy flowers from the vendors as well as
offerings for the dead.  Aside from the obvious flowers and incense often given
when visiting graves, the Chinese also have an array of paper offerings you can
give to your ancestors who are in the afterlife.  These usually include paper
money or shoes and clothes for your ancestors to wear in the afterlife.  In
contemporary China, people have become more creative and modern with their paper
offerings, sometimes giving their ancestors TVs, silverware, cars, cellphones,
and more recently iPads for the loved ones to use in the afterlife.  These more
modern offerings are usually drawn on or made out of paper and are then burned.
I should stress however that Wan An Cemetary does not allow you to do that.  So
with that in mind, I decided to buy a bouquet of flowers instead.  </p>

<p>The sun was shining high and the sky was the deepest of blues as I entered Wan
An I found the reception desk which was also busy with people and managed to get
myself a map of the complex.  I discovered that the graves of my Kung Fu masters
were at the outermost edge of the cemetery with a nice close view of the
mountains near Beijing.  I was also surprised to find that there were already
flowers and offerings laid out for both of the tombs and as I arrived.  A large
group of other people, both men and women, also arrived to make their offerings
to Dong Haichuan and Li Ziming.  I wisely decided not to take pictures of them
or the grave site at this time as they were paying their respects and cleaning
the tomb.  I also did not know if they were family members or also fellow
martial art students as the teachers I came to see died quite a long time ago
(Dong Haichuan in 1882 and Li Ziming in 1993).  I also helped out a little bit
in cleaning and tending to the tombs by clearing away some plastic debris from
the tombs as well as picking up and straightening previous offerings that had
fallen or were blown over by the wind. </p>

<p><a href="/static/image/blog/qingmingjie/donghaichuan_tomb.jpg"><img src="/static/image/blog/qingmingjie/donghaichuan_tomb_m.jpg" alt="董海川"></a></p>

<p>After paying my respects I decided to wander around the graveyard and observe
what other people were doing to honor their ancestors.  I saw many carrying
buckets of water and straw brooms to both sweep and wash the tombs as well as
laying food offerings on the tombstones for the departed.  I saw one family in
particular eating food themselves as laid down their offerings to the graves. An
old man amongst the group with a half-eaten banana in his hand casually talking
to the tombstones as the other family members cleaned the tomb and put down
flowers.  I do not know particularly what he was saying but the way he was
talking it seemed he was keeping them up-to-speed with all of the current family
affairs giving the feel of a family reunion to the reverent atmosphere.  Wan An
also had refreshments laid out around the cemetary for people visiting the
cemetery that day.</p>

<p>All in all, the trip to Wan An Cemetary was interesting, giving insight into how
the modern Chinese still hold on to some traditions of the past while adding a
modern touch.  Qing Ming Festival for many Chinese seems to be a time of
remembrance and of family.  A sentiment some may find cliché but a sentiment
many people can relate to nonetheless.  </p>

<p>Now if you&#39;ll excuse my I&#39;ve got a paper flat screen TV I&#39;ve got to burn for my
grandma.</p>
