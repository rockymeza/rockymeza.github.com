<h1>Contemporary China No. 2: 天津 (tiānjīn)</h1>
<p class="byline">posted on <span class="date">04 Apr 2012</span> by <span class="author">Alex</span></p>

<aside class="notice">
  <p>Instead of having a Chinese culture <em>class</em>, Alex and Rocky are having adventures in and around Beijing.  "Contemporary China" is a series of blog posts that takes a look at our experiences with Chinese culture.</p>
</aside>



<p>Hello Folks, This is Alex here! Rocky&#39;s classmate and partner in crime for this
blog so to speak.  Today I&#39;ll be picking up where Rocky left off.</p>

<p>With our medical worries behind us for now, and on the recommendation of a
fictional doctor Rocky, Kelsey and I decided to leave the crowded bustling city
streets of Beijing and get some clean fresh &quot;country air&quot; by taking the train to
slightly less bustling and crowded city of 天津 (tiānjīn---Tianjin) for a day.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rockymeza/7044331387/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7077/7044331387_e627f8ba3d.jpg" alt="天津"></a></p>

<p>According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianjin">Wikipedia</a>, Tianjin&#39;s name
literally means &quot;The Heavenly Ford&quot;, but Rocky and I affectionately call it Sky
Harbor.  It is, located a few miles from Beijing it was settled around 340BC. In
the Sui Dynasty it developed into an economic trading hub due to its being so
near to many important Chinese waterways.  During the Opium wars of the 1800s
Tianjin came under European control as Britain, France and other western nations
carved out sections of the city for themselves. Tianjin was liberated by the
Chinese Communists shortly after World War II which in turn led to them being
able to capture Beijing and conquer China.</p>

<h2>Getting there is half the battle</h2>

<p>But in order for us to get to this beautiful city we first needed to buy tickets
on China&#39;s new and modern bullet trains!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rockymeza/6898194440/"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5449/6898194440_b3d57a1971.jpg" alt="Ticket Office"></a></p>

<p>Kelsey being an old veteran of China had already taken them a few times before
this trip but this was going to be new experience for Rocky and me.  The closest
I had probably ever gotten to riding a train is the RTD light rail back at home
and the Beijing Subway but this experience would be a little different as I feel
both Beijing&#39;s subways and the RTD light rail cabs do no go as fast as these
high speed bullet trains.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rockymeza/6898196528/"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5466/6898196528_b2e7d8158d.jpg" alt="北京南站"></a></p>

<p>When we arrived at 北京南站 (běijīng nán zhàn---Beijing&#39;s Southern Railway
Station) we immediately noticed the massiveness and the beauty that is found
throughout all of the Chinese modern architecture.  Throughout the complex,
there were many gift shops and restaurants. As expected there were a good number
of people in the train station milling about going from one place to another.  I
saw many people carrying bags, bundles, and suitcases of all shapes and sizes
which made me wonder just how crowded the Beijing station must be when Chinese
New Year&#39;s begins and everyone goes back home to celebrate.</p>

<p>We showed our passports, got our tickets, and shortly thereafter boarded the
train.  The train itself was very well-kept, very clean, and new and the seats
were comfortable with leg room to spare.  The ride itself was pretty smooth I
could hardly believe that we were going over 180 miles per hour on the train by
the feel of it you would think we were barely moving.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rockymeza/7044303141/"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5348/7044303141_41855174c6.jpg" alt="292km/h"></a></p>

<p>It had been over seven years since I last saw what the Beijing country side
looked like and that was before the Olympics and as our high speed train moved
along I found myself looking out the window at what seemed to be the stark
contrast between the city and the countryside in china and also how
modernization was still taking hold in many small villages and towns in China.
We saw fields upon fields of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rockymeza/6898207662/">flooded rice
paddies</a> and other crops as
well as the sight of many villages along the way going under the process of
construction.  Many old-style courtyard houses being torn down as sky scrapers
took their place made me feel a little conflicted seeing such traditional
historic buildings being destroyed but also happy for China&#39;s modernization.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rockymeza/6898209616/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7110/6898209616_9fb266091e.jpg" alt="From the train"></a></p>

<h2>天津到了 (tiānjīn dǎo le)</h2>

<p>When we arrived, we were met by the husband of one of our Chinese teachers,
陈先生 (chén xiānsheng--Mr. Chen) who was to be our guide for this trip and had
been given specific instructions to show us the fun and interesting places of
Tianjin.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rockymeza/7044312807/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7248/7044312807_5a3cfde3ae.jpg" alt="天津到了"></a></p>

<p>The beautiful Hai river greeted us glittering in the shining Spring sun.  We
first saw the bridge that the Chinese communists army crossed in Tianjin in
order to get to Beijing We also saw a giant
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk">Steampunk-esque</a> clock.  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rockymeza/7044313477/"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5445/7044313477_80bb05864a.jpg" alt="Millenium
Clock"></a>
But the most noticeable aspect of Tianjin, as Kelsey pointed out, was its unique
architecture and layout.  As mentioned before Tianjin was once a hub of
influence for many European colonialist powers so naturally they had built some
buildings in their own style to make them feel more at home.  I felt the sun was
playing tricks on my eyes as we saw some very French and Italian looking houses.</p>

<p>We quickly boarded a bus that took us deeper into Tianjin.  Along the way we saw
very strange public service signs telling the locals <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rockymeza/7044330955/">not to drink and
drive</a> or to fall asleep
while driving.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rockymeza/6898221042/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7198/6898221042_f576d0d97f.jpg" alt="食品街"></a></p>

<p>We then took a taxi to the famous 食品街 (shípǐn jiē--Foodstuffs Road) where we
got to sample some of the local cuisine and had a very nice lunch with some
wonderful dishes.  We then make our way to 古文化街 (gǔ wénhuà jiē--Ancient
Culture Street) and the 鼓楼 (gǔ lóu--Drum Tower).  There we saw some
interesting sights such as the first guns I&#39;ve ever seen in China (they were bb
guns).  We also saw leather workshops and clay dolls.</p>

<p>We happened upon an old Confucian temple built around the Ming or Qing dynasty.
After buying the tickets and walking through the metal detector, we entered the
complex and found that we had it all to ourselves.  The first part of the temple
we saw was an old part of the Tianjin palace wall.  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rockymeza/6898227568/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7246/6898227568_c14d44d3f7.jpg" alt="Palace
Wall"></a>
We then past a large statue of 孔子(kǒngzǐ--Confucius) himself and saw a
beautiful koi pond bridge with a well beside it that was supposedly famous and
lucky but sealed off to us by a slab of concrete.  We also saw some of the walls
of the temple had the worlds of Confucius carved on them.
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rockymeza/7044327595/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7046/7044327595_6f0a2cde46.jpg" alt="孔子日"></a>
As we explored the temple some more we found some parts of it were in disrepair
such as bowed-in roofs and sacred ancestral tablets that had broken and fallen
over.  Overall the experience was quite enjoyable and interesting.</p>

<p>We decided to wander around a bookshop for a bit.  There we each bought copies
famous Chinese classics books in Chinese as well as some language books for
French and Spanish that were in Chinese.</p>

<h2>On the way home</h2>

<p>Before heading back to Beijing we got 张老师 some 麻花 (mǎ huà) pastries and
some refreshments for ourselves.  麻花 are Tianjin&#39;s most famous local treat.
It comes in many flavors, such as chocolate, sesame, red bean, original.</p>

<p>We boarded the train back to Beijing and went home.  That was our trip to
Tianjin and this is Alex saying until next time, 再见 (zàijiàn--goodbye)! </p>
